# 🔍 Databricks WAF Light Tooling

## 🚀 Overview

**Databricks WAF Light Tooling** is a lightweight, automated assessment tool built to evaluate Databricks Lakehouse implementations against the **Well-Architected Framework (WAF)** principles. It analyzes system tables, logs, and metadata to generate real-time scores and actionable recommendations that drive better governance, security, performance, and cost-efficiency.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Building a secure, efficient, and well-governed Databricks Lakehouse requires continuous adherence to WAF principles. However, the assessments generally suffer from:

- ⏱️ Time-consuming processes  
- 🔁 Inconsistencies in evaluation  
- ⚙️ Lack of automation  

---

## 🌟 Opportunity Statement

A **WAF Tool** can solve these pain points by offering:

- ✅ Automated WAF assessments  
- 📊 Real-time scoring  
- 🛠 Actionable insights  

…empowering customers to continuously optimize their Databricks environments with minimal effort.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Develop a **lightweight WAF assessment tool** that:

- Automates analysis using **System Tables**, **audit logs**, and **workspace metadata**  
- Provides **real-time scoring** against WAF pillars  
- Highlights **gaps and improvement opportunities**  
- Offers **low-friction deployment** for both internal teams and customers  

---

## 🛠 Existing Alternatives

- Many teams build **custom dashboards** for monitoring.
- These are often:
  - ❌ Manually maintained  
  - ❌ Inconsistent across customers  
  - ❌ Hard to scale or reuse  

**Databricks WAF Light Tooling** offers a reusable, scalable, and automated alternative.

2. **Publishes the Dashboard** - Configures it with a SQL warehouse for data queries
3. **Configures Embedding** - Sets up embedding domains for the Streamlit app
4. **Deploys the Streamlit App** - Creates a Databricks App with interactive WAF Guide sidebar
5. **Updates Configuration** - Automatically configures dashboard IDs and workspace settings

#### Quick Start

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhiDatabricks/Databricks-WAF-Light-Tooling.git
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Installation Process

The `install.ipynb` notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Dashboard Deployment**
   - Reads dashboard JSON from `dashboards/` folder
   - Creates Lakeview dashboard via API
   - Handles existing dashboards (updates if found)

2. **Dashboard Publishing**
   - Finds available SQL warehouse
   - Publishes dashboard with warehouse configuration
   - Verifies dashboard exists and is published

3. **Embedding Configuration**
   - Configures `*.databricksapps.com` as allowed embedding domain
   - Required for Streamlit app to embed the dashboard

4. **App Configuration**
   - Updates `app.py` with correct dashboard ID, instance URL, and workspace ID
   - Preserves comprehensive WAF Guide sidebar

5. **App Deployment**
   - Uploads app files to workspace using Workspace API
   - Deploys app using REST API (CLI not supported in notebooks)
   - Provides app URL upon successful deployment

### Deployment Methods

- **REST API**: Used for app deployment (CLI not supported in notebook environments)
- **Workspace API**: Used for file uploads and dashboard operations
- **Manual Fallback**: Clear instructions provided if API deployment fails

### Authentication

The installation notebook uses Databricks notebook context for authentication:
- No API keys required
- Uses `dbutils` to get API URL and token automatically
- Works seamlessly in Databricks workspace environment

---

## 📊 Data Sources

The dashboard analyzes data from Databricks System Tables:

- `system.billing.usage` - Cost and usage metrics
- `system.information_schema.tables` - Table metadata
- `system.compute.clusters` - Cluster configurations
- `system.compute.warehouses` - Warehouse usage
- `system.access.audit` - Access patterns
- `system.query.history` - Query performance
- `system.mlflow.experiments_latest` - ML experiment tracking
- And more (see `DEVELOPER_DOC.md` for complete list)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading

- Ensure the dashboard is published with a warehouse
- Check that the warehouse is running
- Verify system tables are accessible

### App Not Deploying

- Check that app files were uploaded successfully
- Verify workspace path is correct
- Try manual deployment via Databricks Apps UI (instructions provided in notebook)

### Embedding Issues

**"Embedding dashboards is not available on this domain"**

This error requires a **workspace admin** to enable embedding at the workspace level first. The per-dashboard domain allowlist will not take effect until this is done.

**Step 1 — Enable workspace-level embedding (Admin only)**

Follow the official Databricks guide:
[Control allowed embed destinations](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ai-bi/admin/embed#-control-allowed-embed-destinations)

In short:
1. Go to **Admin Console → Advanced**
2. Enable **"Allow AI/BI dashboard embedding"**
3. Save

**Step 2 — Add `databricksapps.com` as an allowed destination**

Once workspace embedding is enabled, add the domain in the dashboard's Share settings:
1. Open the deployed WAF dashboard
2. Click **Share → Embed dashboard**
3. Add `*.databricksapps.com` to the allowed domains list
4. Save

The `install.ipynb` notebook attempts to configure this automatically via API, but the API call only takes effect after the workspace-level flag is turned on (Step 1 above).

For more help, see the manual deployment steps provided in the installation notebook output.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Planned extensions (see **[EXTENSION_GUIDE.md](EXTENSION_GUIDE.md)** for detailed information):

- **REST API Service**: Programmatic access to WAF scores
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Service**: Integration with AI assistants
- **WAF Recommendation Agent**: AI-powered recommendations using Databricks Vector Search and Foundation Model APIs
- **AI Agent Context Provider**: Structured context for external AI agents and applications
- **One-Click Marketplace Installation**: Package as Databricks App for easy distribution

> **Note**: The extension guide is marked as **Work In Progress (WIP)**. These features are planned but not yet implemented.
