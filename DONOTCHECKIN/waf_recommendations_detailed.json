The simplest way to achieve this is to develop ML applications on the same platform used to manage production data.

For simple ETL workloads, focus on compute-optimized configurations, while memory and storage are important for shuffle-heavy workloads. Balancing the number of workers and instance size is crucial, as both can affect network I/O. Lastly, consider caching benefits for workloads that require frequent re-reads of the same data, using storage-optimized configurations with Delta Cache. \n\nAWS | Azure | GCP\nAWS | Azure | GCP",
